To ensure a proper reindex in TinaCMS, the following files are critical:

1. tina/config.ts
This file contains the configuration for TinaCMS, including details about the schema, Tina Cloud API credentials, and media settings. It defines how Tina connects to your content repository and interacts with the Tina Cloud backend.

Key Points:
Required fields: clientId, branch, schema, and optionally token.
Ensure the schema matches your content structure in your repository.
2. Tina Lock File (.tina/__generated__/_schema.json)
The lock file is generated automatically during the indexing process and ensures that the schema registered in Tina Cloud matches the schema in your local project.

Key Points:
Generated automatically when running npx tinacms build or npx tinacms dev.
Should not be manually edited.
Must be committed to your repository to avoid mismatched schema errors.
3. Tina GraphQL Query File (tina/__generated__/queries.gql)
This file contains all the auto-generated GraphQL queries based on your schema. TinaCMS uses it to interact with your content.

Key Points:
Automatically generated by TinaCMS during indexing.
Needs to be committed to the repository for a consistent setup across environments.
4. Auto-Generated Client File (tina/__generated__/client.ts)
The client file is used to interact with the TinaCMS API in your application. It contains the necessary configuration to fetch data using Tina Cloud.

Key Points:
Automatically generated when running npx tinacms build or npx tinacms init.
Should be imported in your Next.js app to connect TinaCMS with your project.
5. Optional: public/admin/index.html
This file is the static admin panel generated by npx tinacms build. While not strictly required for reindexing, it is necessary if you plan to use the static admin screen.

Summary of Files Required for Reindexing:
Required:

tina/config.ts (Configuration for TinaCMS and Tina Cloud)
.tina/__generated__/_schema.json (Lock file for schema consistency)
tina/__generated__/queries.gql (Generated GraphQL queries)
tina/__generated__/client.ts (Auto-generated client for Tina Cloud API)
Optional for Admin Panel:

public/admin/index.html
Steps to Reindex Properly:
Ensure the schema in tina/config.ts matches your content.
Run the following command to reindex and rebuild:
bash
Copy
Edit
npx tinacms build
Commit the generated files (_schema.json, queries.gql, client.ts) to your repository.
Push changes to your branch connected to Tina Cloud.
Check the indexing status in the Tina Cloud dashboard (Tina Cloud App).
